# Phone Reminder
This app detects when bluetooth disconnects from the watch and shows you a prompt so you can check if you left your phone behind.
When the prompt shows, you can choose to set the location you are currently at as a familiar location, so it won't alert you whenever you are nearby.

This app uses the `MyLocation` app. To set up dynamic location updating with an iOS device, you can use the `BangleDumpLocation` shortcut to push the lcoation. 
For more information on automating this and setup, look [here.](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=ios&readme)


## Settings
* <b>Enabled</b> - Whether or not the app is enabled
* <b>Precision</b> - Change how close you need to be to a familiar location in order for it to not alert you.
* <b>Delete Locations</b> - Deletes all familiar locations.
## TODO
- Add a setting to use watch GPS to get the location instead of myLocation.
